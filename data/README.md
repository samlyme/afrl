# This is where we keep all the training data

Think of this as a "staging area" where we can convert all the data into a consistent format.

There are some files and formats that I do not know how to properly convert.

All the data is not tracked in this repo. Get the data by running everything in the `scripts` dir.

## riotu-lab/Synthetic-UAV-Flight-Trajectories

This contains a bunch of csv files, each being a synthetic flight path.
