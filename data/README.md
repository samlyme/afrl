# This is where we keep all the training data

Think of this as a "staging area" where we can convert all the data into a consistent format.

There are some files and formats that I do not know how to properly convert.

All the data is not tracked in this repo. Get the data by running everything in the `scripts` dir.

## TODO
- put fpv data into its own directory
- format mid-air data
